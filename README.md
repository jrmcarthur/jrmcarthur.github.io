My account is where I can have my repositories, and edit and commit changes to files within GitHub.
The repository that I created is where future assignments will go. It's essentially a whole storage bin where I can keep files and their histories.
I downloaded the Desktop version of Github onto my local laptop, and by logging into my account on the Desktop version, I found the README.md file that I had created, chose a folder to clone it to, and then cloned it.
